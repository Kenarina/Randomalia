Randomalia is probability game about animals. It is designed for all age groups and arouses interest in the world of animals. What makes it special is that despite having a singe user functionality, it is also possible to imgine a or group of users having fun around it, taking advantage of its features.  

## Description ##

The game, Randomalia, is based on lists of animals grouped into  Mammals, Birds, Fish and Reptiles. Some few animals from these classes form the *Predator League*. The user plays against the computer, a.k.a. the *Animal Wizard*. On playing a class of animals is randomly selected, followed by a random selection of an animal from this class, which will be assigned to the player. The same sequence of events will happen for the *Animal Wizard*. For either animal choice, a **rankscore** based on animal class and a **survivalscore** based in membership to the *Predator League* will be computed. The  The player with a higher **Total Score** wins the round.

## User stories ##

The following considerations of the user experience underly the design of the website:  

1. A simple and easily navigable, less crowded website.  

2. Brief introduction to the game and how it is played (home page).

3. Compatibility with user's device.  

4. Visually appealing, less overwhelming and fairly neutral design themes to appeal to wide range of users.   

5. Interactivity and feedback to the user e.g. through deployment of alerts.  

# UX/UI Design #

## Structure ##

The structure of the website was created based on the following wireframes crated with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/):  


## Home Page ##

The home page gives a brief description of how the game and provides a link to the game page. The footer section provides external links to social media pages and a copyright attribution.  

The page is based on this wireframe:

<p><img src="assets/images/Page1-wireframe.PNG" alt="Wireframe for Home Page.">Wireframe for Home Page.</p>  

## Game Page ##

The full game page (in-play mode) has, mainly, a header section, a welcome-remark section, a chosen-animal display section, three score-display sections and a footer.The page is based on this wireframe:

<p><img src="assets/images/Page2-wireframe.PNG" alt="Wireframe for Game Page.">Wireframe for Gallery Page.</p>  

## Responsive Design ##

The website has been optimised for responsive display on mobile phones, tablets, labtops and large screens, as exemplified in the images here:
<p><img src="assets\Images\OHR-Responsive-Home.webp" alt="Displays of the home page on various screen sizes."></p>  

<p><img src="assets\Images\OHR-Responsive-gallery.webp" alt="Displays of the gallery page on various screen sizes."></p>  

## Design themes fonts. ##  

Softness and neutrality were the theme for color and font choice. The text fonts, Open Sans and Oswald from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were preferred for this project. The text is easy on the eye. All images used in this project were previously taken personally. They were not outsourced externally.  

## Testing ##
Basic functionality to achieve desired disign outcomes were progressively done in an iterative process. The project was written using Visual Studio Code and with a Live Server Extension *Live Preview, from Microsoft* together with inspection via the brouser console. The following tests were done manually during the coding process.  

*Functionality of internal links, including the navigation bar links.

*Functionality of external links.

Verification of responsive desing. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge were successfully used for this test.  

Automatic HTML checking was done using [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). All errors and bad code were corrected and recheked until only external links such as from Google Fonts triggered warnings.  The test results were uploaded [here](assets/test-results).
